-- HYGIENE §2 + §5 (TODO_DB_FUNCTION_HYGIENE).
--
-- §2: settle_betting_for_week's once-per-week score_credit mint guard keyed
-- on display text (description LIKE 'Week N %') — a uniqueness key that
-- breaks if copy ever changes. The mint stamps week_id itself, and live data
-- has zero NULL-week score_credit rows (pre-checked), so the guard becomes
-- WHERE week_id = p_week_id AND type = 'score_credit'.
--
-- §5 (decision: option a): the week-close sweep stamped lapsed negotiations
-- as 'cancelled', conflating "I withdrew it" with "it lapsed at archive".
-- 'expired' is already in the status CHECK and the app already renders it
-- (pvp.ts label map; usePvpData buckets by exclusion). DB-only change.
--
-- GENERATED from the live catalog; only the two edits above.
