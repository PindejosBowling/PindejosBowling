-- CREATE OR REPLACE of settle_betting_for_week reusing its current body verbatim
-- (from 20260605120219_add_week_id_to_pin_ledger.sql §3c) and appending a single
-- PERFORM public.process_weekly_loans(p_week_id) as the last statement. This runs
-- garnishment → interest in the same transaction as the score_credit mint, so
-- there is no player-action window between pincome and garnishment (design §6).
-- AdminArchiveModal already calls settle_betting_for_week — no app change needed.
