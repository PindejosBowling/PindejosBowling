# PindejosBowling Native — Agent Reference

## Project Overview

React Native / Expo app for a recreational bowling league called "Pindejos." Players track weekly matchups, scores, standings, RSVPs, and historical stats. The sole backend is a Supabase Postgres database accessed via typed query objects in `src/utils/supabase/db.ts`.

---

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Library / Version |
|---|---|
| Runtime | React Native 0.85 via Expo SDK 56 |
| UI framework | React 19.2 |
| Language | TypeScript (strict enough; some `any` in data layer) |
| State | Zustand 5 |
| Navigation | React Navigation 7 (bottom tabs + native stack) |
| Storage (prefs) | `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` |
| Charts | `react-native-gifted-charts` |
| Fonts | Barlow + Barlow Condensed via `@expo-google-fonts` |
| Gradients | `react-native-linear-gradient` |
| Database | Supabase (Postgres) via `@supabase/supabase-js` |

Run with `expo start` from `app/`. Use `--ios`, `--android`, or `--web` flags.

---

## Backend / Data Layer

All data reads and writes go through Supabase via the typed query objects in `src/utils/supabase/db.ts`.

**Files:**

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [src/utils/supabase/client.ts](src/utils/supabase/client.ts) | `createClient<Database>()` — import `supabase` from here for raw queries |
| [src/utils/supabase/database.types.ts](src/utils/supabase/database.types.ts) | Auto-generated Postgres types: `Database`, `Tables<T>`, `TablesInsert<T>`, `TablesUpdate<T>` |
| [src/utils/supabase/db.ts](src/utils/supabase/db.ts) | Typed query objects, one per table — **always use these over raw client calls** |

The client is configured via Expo environment variables that are set in `.env.local` (`EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_API_KEY`) and uses AsyncStorage for session persistence.

---

## Database Schema (11 tables)

| Table | Key columns |
|---|---|
| `app_credentials` | `role`, `password_hash` |
| `players` | `id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `name`, `phone`, `role`, `user_id`, `is_active`, `created_at` |
| `seasons` | `id`, `number`, `league_name`, `bowling_night`, `started_at`, `ended_at` |
| `weeks` | `id`, `season_id`, `week_number`, `is_archived`, `is_confirmed`, `bowled_at` |
| `rsvp` | `id`, `player_id`, `week_id`, `status`, `note`, `updated_at` |
| `teams` | `id`, `week_id`, `team_number` |
| `team_slots` | `id`, `week_id`, `team_id`, `slot`, `player_id`, `is_fill` |
| `games` | `id`, `week_id`, `game_number`, `team_a_id`, `team_b_id` |
| `scores` | `id`, `team_slot_id`, `game_id`, `score`, `updated_at` |
| `season_champions` | `id`, `player_id`, `season_id` |
| `board_posts` | `id`, `player_id`, `message`, `created_at` |

**Key distinctions:**
- `weeks.is_archived` — `true` once the week has been bowled and scores are final. All historical queries filter to archived weeks.
- `weeks.is_confirmed` — `true` once teams have been generated and locked for the week. Used to distinguish an active (live-scoring) week from a pending one.
- `team_slots.is_fill` — `true` for league-avg fill placeholders. Excluded from personal stats but included in team totals. **Generated column** (`player_id IS NULL`) — readable but never written; a fill is simply a slot with no `player_id`.
- **`teams` is the team entity.** A team is one `(week_id, team_number)` pairing. `team_slots.team_id` (who's on the team) and `games.team_a_id`/`team_b_id` (the matchup) both reference it via composite `(team_id, week_id)` FKs that enforce a slot/game can only point at a team in its own week. `team_number` survives on `teams` purely for the "Team N" display label — **all matching/joining keys on the team UUID.**

## Data Architecture

### Hook-based data pattern

Each screen (or group of screens) has a corresponding hook in `src/hooks/`. The hook fetches raw Supabase data, exposes it alongside a `reload` function, and the screen derives display data via `useMemo`. Many hook files also export standalone **compute functions** — pure functions that accept raw data and return derived UI data.

```
┌─────────────┐      ┌──────────────┐      ┌────────────────────────┐
│   Screen    │ uses │     Hook     │ uses │      db.ts / Supabase  │
│  (useMemo)  │◄─────│ rawScores,   │◄─────│  scores.listForXxx()  │
│             │      │ rawSchedule, │      │  games.list...         │
│             │      │ loading,     │      │  seasons.list()        │
│             │      │ reload       │      └────────────────────────┘
└─────────────┘      └──────────────┘
        │
        ▼
   computeXxx(rawScores, rawSchedule, ...)
   (pure, exported from hook file)
```

### Archived vs. live data

- **Archived weeks** (`is_archived = true`): all historical stats, standings, records, chemistry. Always filtered in the specialized `scores.listForXxx()` queries.
- **Active week** (`is_archived = false, is_confirmed = true`): the live scoreboard used by `MatchupsScreen`. Fetched by `weeks.getActive()`.

### Standings computation

Win/loss is determined by comparing **team totals** (all players on a team including fill) per game. The `games` table defines which team faced which via `team_a_id`/`team_b_id`. All compute functions key the opponent/total maps on the **team UUID** (`team_slots.team_id` ↔ `games.team_a_id`/`team_b_id`), e.g. `` `${gameId}|${teamId}` ``. The `computeStandingsFromSupabase` function (exported from `useStandingsData.ts`) implements this and is reused by multiple screens.

### Effective avg for matchups

`useMatchupsData` computes a per-player avg from the previous season's archived scores. Fill slots and Out-RSVP'd players are assigned the league avg. This is not user-configurable.

---

## Hooks

**File:** `src/hooks/`

| Hook file | Exported hook | Exported compute functions | Used by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `useStandingsData.ts` | `useStandingsData` | `computeStandingsFromSupabase(rawScores, rawSchedule, seasonId)` | StandingsScreen, PastSeasonsScreen |
| `useMatchupsData.ts` | `useMatchupsData` | — | MatchupsScreen |
| `usePlayerDetailData.ts` | `usePlayerDetailData(name)` | `computePlayerProfile`, `computePersonalRecords`, `computeCurrentTeam`, `computeWeekRows`, `computeChartPoints(playerId, allScores, allSchedule, seasonId)`, `computeExpandedMatchups`, `computePlayerSeasons` | PlayerDetailScreen |
| `useChemistryData.ts` | `useChemistryData` | `computeChemistryFromSupabase(rawScores, rawSchedule, groupSize)` | ChemistryScreen |
| `useH2HData.ts` | `useH2HData` | `computeH2HFromSupabase(p1Name, p2Name, rawScores, rawSchedule)` | HeadToHeadScreen |
| `useLeagueRecordsData.ts` | `useLeagueRecordsData` | `computeLeagueRecordsFromSupabase(rawScores, filterSeasonId)` | LeagueRecordsScreen |
| `usePastSeasonsData.ts` | `usePastSeasonsData` | — (uses `computeStandingsFromSupabase`) | PastSeasonsScreen |
| `usePastGamesData.ts` | `usePastGamesData` | `computePastGamesFromSupabase(rawScores, rawSchedule, seasonId)` | PastGamesScreen |
| `usePlayerManagementData.ts` | `usePlayerManagementData` | — | PlayerManagementScreen |
| `useRefresh.ts` | `useRefresh(fn)` | — | All screens with pull-to-refresh |

### Hook return shapes

All data hooks return at minimum:
```ts
{ loading: boolean, reload: () => Promise<void> }
```
Plus raw data slices specific to that hook (`rawScores`, `rawSchedule`, `seasonList`, `playerNames`, etc.).

### `useRefresh(fn)`

Accepts any async function and returns `{ refreshing, onRefresh }` for use with `RefreshControl`. Pass the hook's own `reload`:

```tsx
const { reload } = useMatchupsData()
const { refreshing, onRefresh } = useRefresh(reload)
```

---

## Pure Data Utilities

**File:** [src/utils/helpers.ts](src/utils/helpers.ts)

| Function | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `initials(name)` | 2-char initials from a full name |
| `timeAgo(date)` | Human-readable relative time string ("2h ago", "3d ago") |
| `combinations(arr, k)` | All k-length combinations of an array — used by chemistry calculation |
| `spreadAndML(t1, t2)` | Bowling spread + moneyline odds from two expected team totals |

---

## State Management

Three Zustand stores — all imported as `useXxxStore` hooks:

### `usePendingStore` ([src/stores/pendingStore.ts](src/stores/pendingStore.ts))
Optimistic edit buffer — not persisted. Holds staged changes before save.
- `pendingRSVP: Record<playerName, 'In'|'Out'>` — staged RSVP changes
- `pendingScores: Record<'teamSlotId|gameNum', scoreString>` — staged score edits
- `genTeams` / `genNumTeams` / `genTeamSize` / `genAvgSource` / `genFillMode` / `genFillToSize` / `genSwapTarget` — state for the Generate Teams admin flow

Pending score key format: `"${teamSlotId}|${gameNum}"` where `gameNum` is the integer game number (1, 2, 3)

### `useUiStore` ([src/stores/uiStore.ts](src/stores/uiStore.ts))
Ephemeral UI state — toggles, selections, toast queue. All fields via `set(partial)`. Key fields:
- `matchupsView` — `'scores'` | `'expected'`
- `expandedWeek` — week id for expanded row in past seasons
- `standingsSeason` — season filter for StandingsScreen
- `playerSeason` — season filter for PlayerDetailScreen
- `recordsSeason` — season filter for LeagueRecordsScreen (`'all'` or season id string)
- `playerLogMode` — `'bowled'` | other — controls game log display in PlayerDetailScreen
- `chemMode` — `'pairs'` | `'trios'`
- `chemExpanded` — boolean, whether chemistry rows are expanded
- `h2hP1`, `h2hP2` — selected player names for head-to-head
- `oddsRevealed` — easter egg toggle on matchup screen
- `toasts` — call `showToast(msg, type)` to show a 2.4s auto-dismissing toast

---

## Navigation Architecture

**Root:** Bottom tabs (`@react-navigation/bottom-tabs`)

| Tab label | Navigator / Screen | Route name |
|---|---|---|
| Standings | StandingsStackNavigator | `Standings` |
| RSVP | RsvpScreen | `RSVP` |
| This Week | MatchupsScreen | `Matchups` |
| More | MoreStackNavigator | `More` |

**Standings tab** is a native stack navigator:

| Route | Screen |
|---|---|
| `StandingsList` | StandingsScreen |
| `PlayerDetail` | PlayerDetailScreen — receives `{ name: string }` param |

**More tab** is a native stack navigator:

| Route | Screen |
|---|---|
| `MoreHome` | MoreHomeScreen — tile grid entry point |
| `LeagueRecords` | LeagueRecordsScreen |
| `HeadToHead` | HeadToHeadScreen |
| `Chemistry` | ChemistryScreen |
| `PastSeasons` | PastSeasonsScreen — season-by-season summary |
| `TrashBoard` | TrashBoardScreen |
| `Playoffs` | PlayoffsScreen |
| `PlayerManagement` | PlayerManagementScreen — add, edit, and toggle active/inactive players |
| `PastGames` | PastGamesScreen — browse historical week rosters and scores by season |

**Cross-tab navigation to PlayerDetail** (e.g. from More tab):
```tsx
(navigation as any).navigate('Standings', { screen: 'PlayerDetail', params: { name } })
```

---

## Component Inventory

| Component | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `AppHeader` | App logo + current Week/Season badge, reads from Supabase (`weeks.getCurrent`, `seasons.getLatest`) |
| `ScreenHeader` | Reusable titled header for inner screens |
| `Toast` | Absolute-positioned animated toast, reads from `uiStore.toasts` |
| `ConfirmBar` | Sticky bottom bar for pending saves (RSVP, scores) |
| `PlayerScoreRow` | One player row in the live matchup view — editable score input or expected avg display |
| `OddsBlock` | Betting-style spread + moneyline card (easter egg, `Expected` mode only) |
| `LoadingView` | Centered spinner with label |
| `PillFilter` | Horizontal pill-style filter row for season/week selectors |
| `ToggleGroup` | Segmented toggle control for multi-option switches |
| `HistoricalTeamBlock` | Team block for displaying archived week rosters |
| `ProfileMenuModal` | Bottom sheet opened from the avatar in `AppHeader` — shows player identity and per-user actions (My Profile, Log Out) |
| `PlayerPickerModal` | Full-screen player search/select for H2H |
| `AdminArchiveModal` | Confirm dialog — archives active week (sets `is_archived = true`, creates next week row) |
| `AdminEndSeasonModal` | Confirm dialog — records season champions and creates new season row |
| `AdminGenerateTeamsModal` | Generate balanced teams from RSVP list, preview swaps, write teams/slots/schedule to Supabase |

---

## Key Patterns

### useMemo for derived data
Every screen derives display data with `useMemo`. The canonical pattern:

```tsx
const { loading, rawScores, rawSchedule, seasonList } = useStandingsData()
const activeSeason = useUiStore(s => s.standingsSeason)

const standings = useMemo(
  () => computeStandingsFromSupabase(rawScores, rawSchedule, activeSeason),
  [rawScores, rawSchedule, activeSeason],
)
```

Do not call compute functions outside of `useMemo` in render — they scan full data sets on every call.

### Pull-to-refresh
Every scrollable screen uses `useRefresh(reload)` from `src/hooks/useRefresh.ts`, passing the hook's own `reload` function:

```tsx
const { loading, rawScores, reload } = useStandingsData()
const { refreshing, onRefresh } = useRefresh(reload)
// pass refreshing/onRefresh to RefreshControl
```

### Pending / optimistic score edits
`usePendingStore.pendingScores` holds unsaved score changes. `MatchupsScreen` renders them immediately and shows a `ConfirmBar`. On save, `scores.upsert` is called, then `reload()` refreshes from Supabase, then the pending buffer is cleared. On discard, pending is just cleared.

### Admin flows (all Supabase direct)
- **Archive week** (`AdminArchiveModal`) — sets `weeks.update(id, { is_archived: true })`, then inserts a new week row for the next week number
- **Add/edit player** (`PlayerManagementScreen`) — inline modal calls `players.insert` or `players.update`; first name, last name, and phone are all required
- **End season** (`AdminEndSeasonModal`) — writes `season_champions.insert` for selected champions, then calls `seasons.insert` for the new season
- **Generate teams** (`AdminGenerateTeamsModal`) — reads RSVP + player avgs, computes balanced teams client-side, previews swaps, then wipes the week (scores → team_slots → games → teams) and writes `teams.insert` (capturing the new ids) → `team_slots.insert` + `games.insert` (both referencing `team_id`/`team_a_id`/`team_b_id`) → `weeks.update(..., { is_confirmed: true })`

---

## Theme System

**File:** [src/theme.ts](src/theme.ts)

Dark theme only. Import `colors`, `fonts`, `radius`.

```ts
colors.bg        // #0a0a0c  — page background
colors.surface   // #131316  — card background
colors.surface2  // #1c1c21  — raised surface
colors.surface3  // #25252b  — element on surface
colors.accent    // #e8ff47  — primary accent (yellow-green)
colors.accentDim // rgba(232,255,71,0.12) — translucent accent tint
colors.accent2   // #ff4f6d  — secondary accent (red)
colors.accent3   // #4fc3ff  — tertiary accent (blue)
colors.gold      // #fbbf24  — champion gold
colors.text      // #f0f0f0  — body text
colors.muted     // #7a7a85  — secondary text
colors.muted2    // #55555e  — tertiary / disabled text
colors.border    // rgba(255,255,255,0.08)
colors.border2   // rgba(255,255,255,0.14) — stronger border
colors.danger    // #ff4f6d
colors.success   // #4ade80
```

Typography uses **Barlow Condensed** for labels/headings/stats and **Barlow** for body text:
```ts
fonts.barlow               // Barlow_400Regular
fonts.barlowMedium         // Barlow_500Medium
fonts.barlowSemiBold       // Barlow_600SemiBold
fonts.barlowCondensed      // BarlowCondensed_700Bold
fonts.barlowCondensedHeavy // BarlowCondensed_900Black
```

Border radii:
```ts
radius.card   // 18 — large cards
radius.cardMd // 14 — medium cards
radius.cardSm // 12 — buttons, inputs
radius.icon   // 10 — avatar/icon boxes
```

## Page Creation

You must ALWAYS reference [PAGE_CREATION.md](PAGE_CREATION.md) when working on new pages or editing existing pages.

It contains hook patterns, screen skeleton, navigation wiring, database migration workflow, and type regeneration. Follow it when adding any new screen or making schema changes.

---

## Important Notes for Agents

1. **All data comes from Supabase.** 

2. **All database queries MUST be implemented in `db.ts`.** Queries like `scores.listForStandings()` join the right tables in one round-trip. Avoid building ad-hoc joins from raw `supabase` client calls; add a new method to `db.ts` if needed.

3. **Archived = historical.** All stat computation queries filter `is_archived = true`. The current/active week is identified by `is_archived = false` (and `is_confirmed = true` for live scoring).

4. **Compute functions are pure.** Functions like `computeStandingsFromSupabase` scan full data arrays on every call with no caching. Always wrap in `useMemo` at the screen level.

5. **Hook files export both the hook and compute functions.** If you need the derived data type shape, import it from the hook file (e.g. `StandingsRow` from `useStandingsData.ts`).

6. **No memoization inside hooks or compute functions.** Caching is the screen's responsibility via `useMemo`.

7. **All source files are TypeScript.** Screens, hooks, and utilities are fully typed `.ts`/`.tsx`.

8. **No test suite.** Verify behavior manually via the Expo dev server (`expo start`).

9. **Auth layer is active.** Phone OTP login is required. User identity is derived from `auth.users` and linked to `players` via `players.user_id`. The `useAuthStore` exposes `userId`, `playerId`, `playerName`, and `role`. See [supabase/AUTH.md](supabase/AUTH.md) for the full architecture — JWT hook, trigger, RLS patterns, and role management.

10. **`useRefresh` requires a function argument.** Pass the `reload` from the screen's data hook: `useRefresh(reload)`. It is not bound to a global store refresh.

11. **Supabase CLI requires `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` — no MCP server is configured.** Always load the token from `app/.env.local` and use `--linked` with `--workdir` pointing to the repo root. Never run `supabase` commands without this setup or they will fail with 401.

  ```bash
  SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN=$(grep '^SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN=' app/.env.local | cut -d'=' -f2) \
    supabase db query --linked --workdir $(pwd) \
    "SELECT ..."
  ```

12. **ALL database changes MUST go through migration files — never write to the database directly.** This is a hard rule with no exceptions. Every schema change (DDL: `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`, index additions, RLS policy changes, trigger changes, etc.) MUST be written as a `.sql` file in `supabase/migrations/` and applied via `supabase db push`. The Supabase CLI may ONLY be used for two purposes:
    - **Reading** — `supabase db query` to inspect the current database state and confirm schema or data.
    - **Pushing migrations** — `supabase db push` to apply a migration file you have already written to `supabase/migrations/`.

  Never use `supabase db query` (or any other tool) to execute `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`, or any other write statement against the live database. If a change needs to be made, write a migration file first.

  **Creating a migration file:** Always use the CLI to generate the file — never create it manually. This ensures the timestamp prefix is correct and consistent:
  ```bash
  SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN=$(grep '^SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN=' app/.env.local | cut -d'=' -f2) \
    supabase migration new short_description --workdir $(pwd)
  ```
  This creates an empty `supabase/migrations/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_short_description.sql` file. Write your SQL into that file, then push it. **`--workdir` must be the repo root** (`migration new` writes to `<workdir>/supabase/migrations/`) — pointing it at `supabase/migrations` nests the file at `supabase/migrations/supabase/migrations/`.

  **To apply a migration:**
  ```bash
  SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN=$(grep '^SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN=' app/.env.local | cut -d'=' -f2) \
    supabase db push --linked --workdir $(pwd)
  ```

  **Why:** Migration files are version-controlled and reversible. Direct writes bypass this safety net and make schema drift impossible to track or roll back.
