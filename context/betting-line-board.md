# Betting Line Board — Place Bets composition

The **Place Bets** view in [src/screens/SportsbookScreen.tsx](../app/src/screens/SportsbookScreen.tsx) renders open betting markets as a board of collapsible sections. It is built as a **reusable, market-type-agnostic stack** so new market kinds (props, team totals, season-long futures) drop in by adding data + a few pure helpers — **with no new rendering code**. Over/under was the first consumer; **game moneylines** are the second (see the moneyline note below) — the board rendered them with no new component code, validating the seam. **Read this before adding a market type to the board.** (Schema/RPC side of adding a bet type lives in [supabase/PIN_ECONOMY_SCHEMA.md](../supabase/PIN_ECONOMY_SCHEMA.md) §7 — keep that authoritative; this section is the **UI** counterpart.)

### The layers (data → screen)

```
usePinsinoData.ts                         (data shapes + market-type seams)
  LineView  ── normalizeMarket(raw) ──  one bettable market, flattened
  SelectionView                          one bettable side (over/under/yes/…)
  helpers: lineGroup · lineCategory · selectionBetsAgainstSubject · closedBettingNote
        │  openLines: LineView[]
        ▼
SportsbookScreen   groups openLines:  game group → line category → lines
        │
        ▼
LineRowContainer   collapsible section (one per category; owns its own collapse state)
        │
        ▼
LineRow            one market row; renders N selection buttons from line.selections
```

### Data shapes (`usePinsinoData.ts`)

- **`SelectionView`** — one `bet_selections` row, flattened: `{ selectionId, key, label, line, odds }`. `key` is the stable side key (`'over'`, `'under'`, `'yes'`, a player id, …); `label` is the display text (rendered uppercased). **Generic** — carries any side, not just over/under.
- **`LineView`** — one market + its selections: `{ marketId, marketType, title, subjectPlayerId, subjectName, gameNumber, line, selections: SelectionView[], inProgress }`. `line` is the **shared** line only when every selection agrees on one (the O/U case); otherwise `null`. `inProgress` = market closed for betting (`status = 'closed'`). `gameNumber` is **nullable** (season-long markets have none).
- `normalizeMarket(raw)` builds a `LineView` from the `MARKET_GRAPH` embed (`bet_selections(*)`), sorting selections by `sort_order`. The hook's `openLines` is `LineView[]`.

### Market-type seams — the **only** places that branch on `market_type`

All four are **pure, exported** functions in `usePinsinoData.ts`. Adding a market type means adding a `case` here, not touching the components.

| Helper | Returns | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `selectionBetsAgainstSubject(marketType, selectionKey)` | `boolean` | **Anti-tanking.** `true` for the side that bets *against* the subject (the `under` on O/U). The screen blocks a player backing this on their own market — also enforced by the `bet_legs_no_self_tank` trigger + the `place_house_bet` RPC (defense in depth). |
| `lineGroup(line)` | `LineGroup {key,label,sortOrder}` | The **outer** section (a game heading). Per-game → `GAME N`; no game → `SEASON` (sorts last). |
| `lineCategory(line)` | `LineCategory {key,label,sortOrder}` | The **inner** collapsible section — one `LineRowContainer`. `over_under` → `Player Overs` (the "under" side is UI-hidden, so the label drops it); `moneyline` → `Moneylines`; else a `title`-based fallback. |
| `closedBettingNote(line)` | `string` | The italic in-progress note copy, market-type aware (game vs. non-game wording). |

### Grouping (two levels, in SportsbookScreen)

`openLines` is bucketed **game group → line category → subject rows** in one `useMemo`: within a category, lines sharing a `subjectPlayerId` consolidate into ONE row — the player's unified button set (`142.5+ PINS · 4.5+ STRIKES · 2.5+ SPARES`, score line first, then stat props); subject-less lines key by market id (one row each). Player rows then **group by their week team** — the viewer's team first, the rest in first-appearance order — and carry a subtle background tint (`subjectRelation`): green-cast for teammates, red-cast for the viewer's matchup opponents (that game for per-game lines, any game for night lines), plain surface otherwise; the moneyline's "Your Team" row shares the teammate green (it is, by construction, the viewer's side). Team data flows from the hook's `weekTeams` (`{ myTeamId, teamByPlayer, opponentTeamByGame }`). The screen renders **one collapsible `<LineRowContainer>` per outer group** — `Weekly Overs`, `Game 1`, `Game 2`, … (no plain text headers) — holding the group's specials, its moneyline row, and the team-grouped player rows, in category sort order. So a single game can show several independently-collapsible sections — Player Overs today, Team Totals / Moneylines later. Containers **start collapsed** (`defaultCollapsed`); the collapsed bar summarizes the category (`label` + `N LINES` count). `SEASON`-scoped markets form their own outer group at the end.

### Components

- **`LineRow`** (`{ lines, isLast, inProgress?, selectionState?, onSelect? }`) — presentational row for **one betting subject** holding ≥1 markets. Subject (+ optional `subtitle` metadata) on the left; **one pick button per (line, selection)** across all its markets on the right (data-driven, never hardcoded over/under; buttons wrap when the set outgrows the row). Single-market rows (moneyline) are the one-element case. **The button IS the line being agreed to** (`selectionButtonLabel`): every offered side is an over (unders are UI-hidden — all bets are over by definition), so an over side renders as the full condition — threshold + what's counted: `142.5+ PINS` on a score line, `4.5+ STRIKES` / `62.5+ CLEAN %` on a stat prop — while lineless sides (moneyline) keep their label (`WIN`). Mirrors `BetRow`'s "callers gate the callbacks" design:
  - `onSelect(sel)` — what a tap does. Omitted / `inProgress` → inert pills.
  - `selectionState(sel) → { selected?, disabled? }` — **cosmetic only**. `disabled` dims a button but leaves it **pressable**, so the screen's handler still runs (e.g. to toast the anti-tank message). Pressability is governed solely by `inProgress` / presence of `onSelect`.
- **`LineRowContainer`** (`{ title, count, note?, defaultCollapsed?, rows }`) — a collapsible section wrapping a set of rows. **Owns its own collapse state**, so each instance toggles independently of the others; the header is a tappable summary bar (title + `N LINES` + ▾/▸ chevron) and is the primary affordance when collapsed. Presentational — the screen builds the rows. `rows` is a `CollapsibleRow[]` of `{ key, pinned?, render(isLast) }`: the container owns the **visible set** (collapsed → `pinned` rows only; expanded → all) and passes each visible row its `isLast` so borders stay correct as the set changes. **`pinned` keeps a row visible while collapsed** — the screen marks slip-selected lines pinned in parlay mode, so a player's picks stay on-screen under a collapsed header while they build across sections. Whenever any rows are pinned, the bar prefixes the count with an accent `N SELECTED · M LINES` hint (shown open or collapsed).

### How the screen wires selection behavior

The screen owns the betting context (balance, parlay slip, identity) and passes per-mode callbacks into each `LineRow`:

- **Single mode** — `onSelect` opens the wager sheet pre-picked to that selection; `selectionState` dims for `balance < 10` or anti-tank.
- **Parlay mode** — `onSelect` toggles the selection in/out of the slip (one selection per market); `selectionState` marks the slip's selection `selected` and dims anti-tank sides. Lines in the slip are passed to `LineRowContainer` as **`pinned`**, so they stay visible even when their section is collapsed (build-across-sections UX).
- **In progress** — `inProgress` dims the whole row and makes every side inert.

`isSelfTank(line, sel)` in the screen is the single anti-tank predicate: `line.subjectPlayerId === playerId && selectionBetsAgainstSubject(line.marketType, sel.key)`. It gates the single sheet, the parlay toggle, and the placement (the server re-checks regardless).

### UI-hidden selections — the "under" is disabled in the Sportsbook

The **"under" side of player O/U lines is intentionally not bettable** from the Sportsbook. In a small rec league, betting on a leaguemate to do *poorly* has negative social dynamics, so the pick is removed from the board rather than offered. This is a **pure presentation policy**, not a mechanic change:

- **Where:** `SportsbookScreen.tsx` — `isSelectionHiddenInUI(line, sel)` (the policy predicate, `over_under` + `key === 'under'`) and `withVisibleSelections(line)` (strips hidden selections), applied once in the `lineGroups` `useMemo`. Because the filtered `LineView` is what flows into `LineRow`, the parlay slip, and the single-bet sheet, the `under` cannot be selected, parlayed, or shown anywhere downstream. A line that ends up with zero visible selections is dropped from the board.
- **What is *not* touched:** the `under` `bet_selections` row, `normalizeMarket`, `selectionBetsAgainstSubject` (anti-tank still encodes `under` as the against-subject side), and the DB/RPC layer (`place_house_bet`, settlement) all handle `under` exactly as before. The mechanic is fully preserved server-side.
- **Re-enabling:** delete `isSelectionHiddenInUI` / `withVisibleSelections` and restore the plain `for (const line of openLines)` loop in `lineGroups`. No DB or migration work needed. To hide a *different* side (or a side on a future market type) instead, extend `isSelectionHiddenInUI`.

### Game moneylines (the second consumer)

**Moneylines** ("which team wins this game?") are live alongside O/U, proving the seam — they reuse `LineRow` / `LineRowContainer` / the grouping unchanged. Key differences from O/U, all absorbed by the existing shapes:

- **Subject = a game, not a player.** A new `bet_markets.subject_game_id` (uuid → `games.id`) points at the matchup; `subject_player_id` is null. In the DB a moneyline market has **two** selections (`bet_selections.key = team_id`, `label = "Team N"`, `line = null`, even-money). The *board* reshapes this — see the next bullet.
- **"Your Team" only (social policy), shaped like a player prop.** A player may bet **only their own team to win**. The hook ([usePinsinoData.ts](../app/src/hooks/usePinsinoData.ts) `toYourTeamMoneyline`) reduces each moneyline `LineView` to the single selection whose `key` matches the player's week team (`teamSlots.getTeamForPlayerWeek`) and reshapes the row to mirror an O/U prop: `subjectName = "Your Team"`, `subtitle = "MONEYLINE · vs <opponent>"` (the opponent's label, captured before its selection is dropped), and the surviving selection relabeled `"Win"` (→ a single `WIN` button). Matchups the player isn't in **drop out**, so per game a player sees exactly one moneyline row. The opponent side is hidden from the UI but still exists in the DB (settlement needs both). *This is a player-board policy; the house/admin views (`useHousePinsinoData`) and placed-bet history show the real team.*
- **`LineView.subtitle`.** A generic optional left-column metadata line (`LineRow` renders it when set). The line value itself is no longer drawn on the left — it lives in the pick button (`selectionButtonLabel`).
- **Headerless section.** The moneyline category renders **without** a `LineRowContainer` (no collapsible header) — [SportsbookScreen.tsx](../app/src/screens/SportsbookScreen.tsx) branches on `category.key === 'moneyline'` and draws the row(s) in a plain card via the shared `renderLine` helper. O/U keeps its collapsible container. `lineCategory` still returns the `moneyline` key (used for grouping/branching) under each `GAME N` group.
- **No line.** `LineView.line = null` ⇒ `LineRow` shows the `subtitle` instead. Placed-bet views (`BetRow`, `BetDetailModal`, `SettleBetModal`, the admin cancel-confirm) gate `line.toFixed(1)` behind `marketType === 'over_under'`; `LegView`/`BetView` carry `marketType`, and `pick` is the selection **label** rather than its key (a uuid).
- **Even money.** Both sides are `2.000`, so `parlayOdds = 2^N` stays exactly correct and moneyline legs parlay freely with O/U legs.
- **No anti-tank.** `selectionBetsAgainstSubject` returns false for moneyline (backing your own team to win is the *only* allowed bet).
- **Auto-generated, auto-settled.** `sync_moneyline_markets_for_week` creates one even-money market per `games` row (wired to **team generation / add-game**, not RSVP — moneylines derive from the schedule). Settlement is automatic on week-archive (`settle_betting_for_week`): winner = the team with the higher combined game score, ties → push. The admin `SettleBetModal` also exposes a manual per-leg path (`settle_moneyline_market`, no score input — derived from entered scores). DB details: [supabase/PIN_ECONOMY_SCHEMA.md](../supabase/PIN_ECONOMY_SCHEMA.md).

### LaneTalk stat props (the third consumer)

**LaneTalk stat lines** (strikes/spares O/U per game, clean% + first-ball avg O/U per night; `market_type='prop'`, `params.stat`/`params.scope`) render through the stack with zero new row components — full feature doc: [lanetalk-stat-bets.md](lanetalk-stat-bets.md). Board specifics:

- **Fetch:** `betMarkets.listActivePropByWeek` merged into `openLines` alongside O/U + moneyline.
- **`LineView.statKey`** (from `params.stat`) — the full condition renders in the pick button (`4.5+ STRIKES`, via `selectionButtonLabel`); prop rows carry no subtitle.
- **Grouping:** per-game props share the score O/U's `Player Overs` category (one collapsible menu per game); night props (`gameNumber == null`) → a `Night Props` category under a new **`WEEKLY`** outer group that leads the board, above the game groups (week-level specials render inside it rather than under their own duplicate `WEEKLY` header).
- **Anti-tank + under-hide:** `selectionBetsAgainstSubject('prop','under') → true`, and `isSelectionHiddenInUI` hides the prop under exactly like the score O/U under (same social policy, same trivial revert).
- **Open/close:** props ride the game toggles (`setPropStatusByWeekGame`); closing game 1 also closes the night markets; `reopenOUForWeek` reopens props too.
- **Placed-bet surfaces** (`BetRow`, `BetDetailModal`, `SettleBetModal`, `LedgerRow`) render the shared `betLineSuffix` helper ("OVER 4.5 STRIKES"); `LegView`/`BetView` carry `statKey`.

### Recipe — adding a new market type to the board

The board needs **no new render code**:

1. **Schema / RPCs** — add the market type per [supabase/PIN_ECONOMY_SCHEMA.md](../supabase/PIN_ECONOMY_SCHEMA.md) §7 (`market_type`, selections, placement/settlement).
2. **Fetch** — add a `db.ts` query (or extend one) returning the new markets with the `MARKET_GRAPH` embed, and surface them in `usePinsinoData` so they land in `openLines`. The *placed-bet* queries (`bets.listByWeek`, `listByPlayer`, `listSettledBySeason`) are deliberately market-type-agnostic — never add a `market_type` filter to them (an inner-join type filter both drops bets with no qualifying leg and prunes legs from mixed parlays' embeds). *Today only `betMarkets.listActiveOUByWeek` feeds the board — season-long markets need a season-scoped fetch, and the empty-state copy is still week-shaped (revisit when that fetch lands).*
3. **`normalizeMarket`** — already generic; just confirm your selections carry `key` / `label` / `line` / `odds` / `sort_order`.
4. **Helpers** — add a `case` to `lineCategory` (section name) and, if a side bets against the subject, to `selectionBetsAgainstSubject`. Touch `lineGroup` only if the scope isn't per-game/season.
5. Done — `LineRow` / `LineRowContainer` / the grouping render it as-is.

> **Known assumption:** `lineCategory` maps `over_under → "Player Overs"` because every O/U subject is a player today. A *team* over/under under the same `market_type` would need the category (and anti-tank) to key off the subject **kind** (player vs team), not `market_type` alone.

### Custom lines ("Specials") — admin-authored bundles of existing selections

**Specials are not markets.** A row in `custom_lines` (one table; see the `…custom_lines` migration header for the DDL) is an admin-authored *presentation template* — title, description, `category` (`'default' | 'special'` → standard vs gold styling) — over existing `bet_selections`. Taking one calls the **unchanged** `bets.place(selectionIds, stake)`; the resulting row is an **ordinary single/parlay** that settles, refunds, archives, and unarchives on the existing rails. There is no specials settlement code anywhere.

- **Legs are abstract specs, resolved weekly.** `custom_lines.legs` is jsonb: `[{ kind: 'over_under'|'moneyline', player_id, game_number, pick: 'over'|'under'|'win' }]`. Specs (not selection FKs) because markets/teams regenerate weekly. A `moneyline` leg means *"the team containing `player_id` wins `game_number`"* — player-anchored because team ids don't persist across weeks.
- **Self-referential legs** (`player_id: null`) make the **taker** the subject — "you beat your over", "your team wins the game". The line then resolves **per-viewer** (subject = the viewer), so each player sees their own framing (`You` / `Your Team` on the row) and the line hides for viewers it can't resolve for (not RSVP'd / not slotted). Self O/U legs are **over-only** — a self `under` would bet against the taker's own performance, which anti-tank blocks for every possible taker (the create modal enforces this; the DB trigger backstops it). Fixed and self legs mix freely on one line.
- **Each-game legs** (`game_number: null`) make the line **materialize once per game** on the week's schedule — each instance binds its null-game legs to that game ("the bettor bowls their over *in this game*" → one offering in each game's group). Instances get synthetic ids (`<rowId>:g<N>`) and flow through the normal per-game board placement; an instance whose game can't resolve (subject not in that game's lineup) is hidden individually.
- **Game picker = `G1 / G2 / BOTH / EACH`** (two official games per night; resolution follows the actual schedule, so an extra game still resolves — the builder just doesn't offer it). `BOTH` is builder sugar for the **week-level cross-game bundle**: it stages one leg per official game in ONE bet ("you beat your over in both games") — the legs land on different markets, the line's derived `gameNumber` goes null, and it renders in the top-of-board card. `EACH` stores `game_number: null` (the per-game offering above). The builder blocks an EACH leg overlapping a fixed-game leg for the same subject (the instance would double up on one market).
- **Lifecycle.** `week_ids uuid[]`: `NULL` = permanent (offered every week while `is_active`); otherwise only in the listed weeks. `is_active = false` pulls it from the board without deleting. Admin CRUD is **direct table writes through RLS** (read-all, admin-write — the `bet_markets` policy set); no money moves at create/edit/delete time.
- **Client-side resolution** (`resolveCustomLine` in [usePinsinoData.ts](../app/src/hooks/usePinsinoData.ts)): each spec is looked up against the **raw** normalized markets — *before* `toYourTeamMoneyline` and the under-hide policy, since a special may bundle selections the viewer's own board hides (specials are **exempt from the hide-the-under policy**: they're admin-curated). Moneyline anchors resolve via `teamSlots.listByWeek` (player → week team → selection `key = team_id`). The line is **hidden** for the week when any leg is unresolvable (subject not bowling, no such game) **or two legs land on the same market** (a degenerate parlay `place_house_bet` would reject). A resolved line with any `closed` leg market renders **inert** (`inProgress`), like every other row.
- **Shapes.** `CustomLegView` (resolved leg: selection/market ids, `subjectName` — `"<anchor>'s Team"` for moneylines — `pick`, `selectionKey`, `line`, `gameNumber`, `odds`, `inProgress`) and `CustomLineView` (`legs`, `selectionIds`, `combinedOdds` = Π leg odds, derived `gameNumber`, `inProgress`). `customLineSelfTank(line, playerId)` mirrors anti-tank for bundles containing an `under` on the viewer's own market (server re-checks regardless).
- **Board placement is derived — specials lead.** All legs in one game → the special renders at the **top of that game's group**, above the standard sections, with **no extra header** (the rows' styling is the distinguishing mark); legs across games — or a game group the viewer's board doesn't show — → a card at the **top of the board** under a **`WEEKLY` header** (same `gameLabel` styling as `GAME 1`/`GAME 2`), above the game groups. There is no "this week" section header — the board opens straight at its `WEEKLY`/`GAME N` labels. Rendered by **`CustomLineRow`** (`{ line, isLast, inProgress?, disabled?, onTake? }`): title/description/leg summary left, one oversized `×odds` multiplier button right (the multiplier *is* the button — no "TAKE" label); `category === 'special'` golds the title + button, `default` uses the standard accent.
- **Take flow.** Tapping the multiplier opens a dedicated wager sheet (leg list, `PAYS ×odds`, to-win preview) → `bets.place(line.selectionIds, wager)`. Specials **never enter the parlay slip** (they already are a bundle), so the button behaves identically in Single and Parlay modes.
- **Bet branding is DB-snapshotted at placement.** `place_house_bet(…, p_custom_line_id)` stamps `bets.custom_line_id` + a **title/description/category snapshot** onto the bet, so the branding is durable — it survives line edits/deletion and renders in historical surfaces (ledger activity, past-week lists, admin views) where live-market matching can't reach. `normalizeBet` reads the columns into `BetView.customLineTitle/Description/Category`; `BetRow`/`LedgerRow` headline the title (gold for `special`) and `BetDetailModal` shows title + description in a `SPECIAL` row. **Legacy fallback:** bets placed before tagging existed are still client-matched by selection-set equality against the current week's resolved specials (incl. per-bettor re-resolution of self-referential lines) — the DB snapshot always wins when present.
- **Admin manager.** `AdminSportsbookScreen` → the `Specials` toggle: list (incl. disabled) → `CustomLineCreateModal` (create/edit: title, description, style, scope This Week / Pick Weeks / Every Week, leg builder) and `CustomLineAdminActionModal` (edit / enable–disable / delete). Edits replace `legs` wholesale and **never affect placed bets** (they hold concrete selection ids).
